# TechTogetherNY

#Description💡:
We wanted to make a web application to help users with the organization of their credit card reward benefits. Credit cards help to provide people with great rewards in specific categories, depending on which card they have. Keeping track of all of the cashback and point multipliers can sometimes get confusing, especially if someone has more than 1 or 2 cards. The app would allow users to add/edit/remove personally owned credit cards and assist in filtering out which specific card they should use for a specific category and occasion. 

#Backend Languages & Packages/Library/Database/Frameworks used 👷‍♂️:
Python
Django -> Flask (flask_sqlalchemy)
PostgreSQL

#Frontend Languages/Frameworks:
JavaScript
React

#Challenges we ran into🕸:
This was our first time setting up a database and webapp environment from scratch so, we had trouble understanding how everything is connected from the database to backend and frontend. Additionally, we also didn’t have any experience with the frameworks that we used in the backend (Flask), so we spent quite a lot of time switching around frameworks to see which one would work and trying to set up the database. In the end, we decided to use Flask and explored different libraries it offers such as flask_sqlalchemy, request, etc.

In the frontend, there were a few bugs that required some extra time to solve, but we were able to get through them.

#If we had more time, what other features would we want to add🔮:
We do want to continue working on this project even after the hackathon and finish up. With the limited time and experience, we were unable to get the backend working completely. We want the project to become more user-friendly and connect to a working database. We would add some of our stretch features, such as a credit cards suggestion page, card utilization tracking, and budgeting.

#What we learned🧠:
We got more familiar with setting up an environment to start a web application. We were also able to learn about the different types of backend frameworks and how to set up cloud hosting services like Microsoft Azure.

#Accomplishments🏆:
Although we were not able to bring our project to completion, we all completed our first in-person hackathon and it was definitely an experience for all of us.

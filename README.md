# CreditPerks

## Purpose of building CreditPerks:

This application was built for the TechTogether NYC hackathon.
The current demo can be accessed on https://christinaor.com/cc-rewards-app.
<br>

## Application Description:

CreditPerks is a financial web application that can help a user track their credit cards and the benefits associated with them. Credit cards provide people with great rewards in general and specific categories, but keeping track of all the benefits (cashback and point multipliers) can become confusing when a user has multiple cards. This application lets the user track their cards, alter the rewards associated with the cards, and filter the cards based on category.

## Frontend Languages/Frameworks used:

-   React
-   JavaScript

## Backend Languages/Frameworks used:

-   Python
-   Django -> Flask (flask_sqlalchemy)
-   PostgreSQL

<br>

## Some challenges:

-   For the majority of the team, this was their first time setting up a database and deploying it. We tinkered with different backend frameworks to decide which one we could work with in a reasonable amount of time. In the end, the team landed on Flask and explored its libraries, such as flask_sqlalchemy, request, etc.

-   We were unable to connect the frontend to the backend during the hackathon, but we would like the fetch requests to be able to access the database in the future.

-   A few bugs were encountered on the frontend, but we were able to solve them in time.

## Stretch Features 🔮

-   Card utilization tracking
-   Credit card suggestions based on card usage
-   Budgeting

## 🧠 What we learned 🧠

The team became more familiar with setting up an environment to start a web application. We also learned about different types of backend frameworks and how to set up cloud hosting services like Microsoft Azure.

## 🏆 Accomplishments

This was everyone's first in-person hackathon and was a great experience!
